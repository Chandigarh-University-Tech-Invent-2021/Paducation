Problem Statement 

There is a risk of a generational catastrophe regarding schooling. Women have faced increased domestic violence, child marriage is projected to rise after a decline in recent years, and unpaid and underpaid care work is increasingly and disproportionately falling on the shoulders of women and girls, impacting educational and income opportunities and health. Notwithstanding the global economic slowdown, concentrations of major greenhouse gases continue to increase. With the global average temperature reaching about 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels, the climate crisis has well and truly arrived, and its impacts are being felt across the world. The pandemic has also brought immense financial challenges, especially for developing countries – with a significant rise in debt distress and dramatic decreases in foreign direct investment and trade.


Challenges

Sanitary pads are more expensive and cause land pollution as compared they cheaper and more eco-friendly alternatives.
People are not aware of such alternatives in the rural areas due to a lack of information
Using sanitary pads still leads to a stigma in people and they often tend to not talk bout their menstrual health.
Biodegradable pads, tampons, menstrual cups are often more expensive initially.
Channelize market and accessibility for such products aren't available for women especially in rural areas.


Technical solutions

75% of girls experience some problems associated with menstruation including delayed, irregular, painful, and heavy menstrual bleeding we aim at making a website that spreads awareness about menstrual hygiene, directs them to well-authorized resources that guide them, and answers questions related to their issues.
These resources consist of apps and established organizations that answer questions related to the correct doctor to consult, proper medication to take in case of complexities, diet to eat, and other alternatives to regular sanitary pads.
Make a period cycle calculator that calculates the expected next date of their period.


Social/economical/natural solutions

Women can be taught to manufacture biodegradable pads, this will provide them economic freedom.
Our website will educate women on the topic of menstrual health and thus help them to better understand the subject.
Studies have shown that one sanitary pad could take from 500 to 800 years to decompose as the plastic used is not bio-degradable, and can lead to health and environmental hazards, our website will promote biodegradable sanitary pads and other environmentally friendly alternatives that will lead to sustainable development.
